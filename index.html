                Hello visitor! This site contains information that provides insight into who I am and 
                what I have accomplished. Most of this site will currently consist of my relevant 
                computer science coursework and projects over the years that I was pursuing my Bachelor's 
                degree. On this site you will find a navigation bar up at the top to other pages. Home is
                where you are currently. About me will tell you a little about myself and my journey to 
                get to where I am now. Projects is the main section of the site that gets updated as I
                finish more projects. Lastly, I hope that after you view what I have done that you go
                over to the contact me page that will have ways that we can get in touch.
            </p>

                Thank you for visiting!
