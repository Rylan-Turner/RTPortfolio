            <h1> About Me </h1>
            <p> Hello, my name is Rylan Turner. Recently, I graduated from University of Houston - Clear
                Lake with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I happen to be a very puzzle-oriented 
                person and I approach this field with that kind of mindset. I tackle new developments as 
                if they were puzzles yet to be solved. Be it a simple logical problem or a research 
                opportunity, I always look forward to solving these puzzles brought about by technology.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout my journey I picked up a few jobs that taught me the importance of working 
                as an effective team and the importance of the many aspects of customer service. The 
                "Scene It Before" project I had to do as part of my final Senior Project class bolstered 
                my capabilites to document things professionally and work effectively with a team of 6 
                people. I hope that this portfolio incentivizes you to <a href="./contactMe.html">contact me</a>
                so that I can become a part of your team and create an impact on the world of technology.
            </p>
