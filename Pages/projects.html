        <h1> Projects </h1>
        <p> This page of the site contains a small portion of the projects I have worked on separated into 
            their own little sections denoted by a white border. The projects toward the top will be video 
            demonstrations of the final version of the product while towards the bottom of the page 
            will have github repo links. None of these projects will be duplicates of others on the page. 
            (i.e. if there is a github repo link then there will be no video demonstration. This is 
            because the video demonstrations are being used to show projects that are easy to understand
            through viewing while the github code repos will be used for things that are easier to 
            understand through browsing the source code and the README file in the repo for guidance.)

                <h1> Summary </h1>
                <p> Scene It Before is a digital stage design tool intended for planning out the look of 
                    theatrical performances with real time collaboration in mind. I worked on this project 
                    with 6 people on a team(including me) during a semester of college. It consists of 3 
                    main parts. These are a website to manage user functionality, a database to manage 
                    user relations to projects, and an editor portion built within Unity. The workflow 
                    is that users create their accounts and projects on the website and manage 
                    collaborators within their projects on the website as well(1st video). They are then 
                    able to choose a project to load which will then allow them to decorate a scene and 
                    others can load the project at the same time and be given all the updates that have 
                    happened since they were gone and see current updates in real time through websocket 
                    programming(2nd video). You can also switch which project you are currently in 
                    through the unity editor instead of having to go back to the website. We ended up with 
                    a product that is roughly 90% finished with the main updates needed being visual 
                    enhancements as it looks a little plain and some minor bugs need fixing.

                <h1> Summary </h1>
                <p> This project had 2 installments. One was a program that handled server interactions 
                    with a single client. The 2nd installment handled server interactions with multiple 
                    clients. The interactions between clients and the server were handled with a FIFO pipe. 
                    The code is also displayed at the start of the recording if you would like to pause 
                    and take a look at that while I scroll through it. Also, to know which interface 
                    belongs to a client or the server you can see me execute the client program or the 
                    server program at the top of the CLI. (denoted by ./client or ./server) <br><br>

                    In the first video it shows the server handling the single client and the calls I make 
                    to the server from the client which are: 
                    <br> 1. Establish a connection. 
                    <br> 2. Convert the given number into text. 
                    <br> 3. Convert the given text into number. 
                    <br> 4. Store something on the server. (in this case the word "Manatee") 
                    <br> 5. Return the stored item to the client. 
                    <br> 6. Terminate the client. 
                    <br> 7. Connect to another client. 
                    <br> 8. Terminate the server as well as the client. <br> <br>

                    In the second video it shows the server handling multiple clients with updated code 
                    from the singular client section and follows a similar scenario where I make these 
                    calls to the server:
                    <br> 1. Establish a connection from the first client window.
                    <br> 2. Establish a connections from the third client window.
                    <br> 3. Establish a connection from the second client window.
                    <br> 4. Convert number to text from the first client window.
                    <br> 5. Convert text to number from the second client window.
                    <br> 6. Store a word "StoredThingy" on the server from the third client window.
                    <br> 7. Retrieve "StoredThingy" and return it to the second client window.
                    <br> 8. Terminate the client belonging to the third client window.
                    <br> 9. Terminate the client belonging to the first client window.
                    <br> 10. Reconnect to the server from the first client window.
                    <br> 11. Reconnect to the server from the third client window.
                    <br> (3:20 is the timestamp) In this section I then show off the file system of how 
                    the FIFO's are being created when a client connects and destroyed when a client exits. 
                    The FIFO belonging to the server is also destroyed when terminating the server along 
                    with the final client.
                    <br> 12. Terminate the client belonging to the first client window and observe the 
                    FIFO file also being deleted.
                    <br> 13. Terminate the client belonging to the second client window and observe the 
                    FIFO file also being deleted.
                    <br> 14. Call to terminate the server and the final client from the third client 
                    window and observe that the final client FIFO and the server FIFO are deleted.

                <h1> Summary </h1>
                <p> This project was from a college course and involved creating a small programming 
                    language from within a high-level programming language, specifically Java. This 
                    repository will have the instructions given by the professor, the java code used 
                    to accomplish the goal, test cases to test the code on, and their associated outputs 
                    given by the professor. There is also a user manual that will run down how to get 
                    this project to work and also has pictures that display the output of my code which 
                    has results that match with the output examples from the professor.

                    Due to this project being quite old, my documentation skills within this repo are 
                    not anywhere near what they are currently. I am planning to update the documentation 
                    in the near future but I need to add some other projects I have worked on to my 
                    portfolio site before that.
